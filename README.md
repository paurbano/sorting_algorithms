# Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Requirements
General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts,  is totally forbidden.
* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you dont have to push them to your repo (if you do we wont take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sort.h
* Dont forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.

# 0. Bubble sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

* Prototype: void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);
* You're expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

* in the best case
* in the average case
* in the worst case
